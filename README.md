## Overview

This is a **dashboard built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and D3.js**, focused on data visualization. It was made in just **two days for a job interview**, with the goal of showing my ability to work with a modern frontend stack.

At the moment, the project **does not fetch data from a real API**. Instead, it uses **mocked data** to simulate realistic content. In the future, I'd like to integrate a **free public API** to make the data dynamic and more relevant.

**Live Demo**: [https://d3dashboard-ten.vercel.app/](https://d3dashboard-ten.vercel.app/)


## Tech Stack

* **Vue 3** with the Composition API
* **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
* **Vite** for lightning-fast builds and hot module replacement
* **Single File Components (SFCs)** using the `<script setup>` syntax
* **D3.js** for interactive data visualizations
* **Sass** and **Bootstrap** for modular and maintainable styling

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sebatanes/d3dashboard.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Future Improvements

* **API Integration**: Replace mock data with a real, public API to make the dashboard dynamic and data-driven.
* **Component Architecture**: Refactor into smaller, reusable components for better maintainability.
* **UI/UX Enhancements**: Improve styling, responsiveness, and accessibility.
* **More Visualizations**: Add multiple types of charts or filters to explore data in different ways.
* **Testing**: Add unit and end-to-end tests to ensure long-term reliability with Vitest.
